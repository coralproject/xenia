16546091	3440983	2	<br/>	I am an attorney who has represented plaintiffs and defendants in many insurance-driven disputes.  Arbitration is used extensively in moderate sized cases in my jurisdiction.  The program works only when knowing choices are made and competent arbitrators are used.  The facts presented here, regarding the individuals who not receive due process, show a consistent pattern by corporate interests to deprive consumers of due process, and to escape penalty for bad corporate behavior.  To blame the victims for not knowing the corporation was actively ripping them off, and suggest, that if they don't like the service, they can shop elsewhere, smack of upper class privilege and a tone deafness to the plight of the working class that is sadly pervasive in our current society.  Too many cries of "let them eat cake" will yield to legislation eviscerating what could be a useful alternative dispute forum.  Ooops, I almost forgot, the same folks that are rigging the system have already bought the legislatures at the state and federal levels.  Game, set, and match.  	56862799	2015-11-02 12:26:18	2015-11-02 12:47:32	2015-11-02 12:47:32	NULL	0	2	0	0	16546091	Jeffrey T13	NULL	NULL	Albuquerque	0	0	userReply	16538110	1
16546092	3441009	2	<br/>	Uh, what about the policies of Hoover and Bush II that very obviously took Democratic administrations to fix. <br/><br/>You analysis is full of non sequiturs and outright misrepresentations. 	57753271	2015-11-02 12:26:18	2015-11-02 17:30:43	2015-11-02 17:30:43	NULL	0	3	0	0	16546092	Paulv	NULL	NULL	Sarasota, FL	0	0	userReply	16541189	0
16546093	3440961	2	<br/>	This is a good start. <br/><br/>First step: admission that the results do not match the model predictions.<br/>Second step: quality control on the data/results.<br/>Third step: re-visit the models.<br/>Fourth step: monitor model vs. data discrepancy.<br/>Repeat. <br/><br/>Nothing else matters. 	63901433	2015-11-02 12:26:24	2015-11-02 12:27:08	2015-11-02 12:27:08	NULL	0	6	0	0	16546093	Kurt in Switzerland	NULL	NULL	Switzerland	0	0	userReply	16533477	0

16546095	3441005	2	<br/>	Terry Collins Should defiantly be fired. He let his emotions get in the way and bowed to peer(fan) pressure... he made the right call initially and should of stuck to it. He was there to win a WORLD Series not to make one person happy... he had the responsibility of ALL the members of the team. That's what you get paid to do, make the tuff calls. Well at least he gave every other manager an idea what not to do.  	73361759	2015-11-02 12:26:29	2015-11-02 12:56:37	2015-11-02 12:56:37	NULL	0	4	0	0	16546095	Chris	NULL	NULL	Chicago	0	0	comment	NULL	0
16546096	3440613	2	<br/>	While there may be qualified students who are being shut out due to spaces reserved for international students, the article doesn't say that.  It may be that the higher tuition paid by international students provides funding for buildings and people that benefit both those students and the subsidized in-state kids.	8493269	2015-11-02 12:26:31	2015-11-02 14:36:49	2015-11-02 14:36:49	NULL	0	0	0	0	16546096	PeteM	NULL	NULL	Flint, MI	0	0	userReply	16534732	1

16546098	3441019	2	<br/>	The refugees on the train are looking at the officer who rescued a little girl (wearing pink under the blue blanket) and he is somehow in awkward position, that can be told from the look on his face he does not have a much experience with babies. 	73308388	2015-11-02 12:26:34	2015-11-02 12:34:35	2015-11-02 12:34:35	NULL	0	0	0	0	16546098	Mariah	NULL	NULL	VT LCI	0	0	comment	NULL	0
